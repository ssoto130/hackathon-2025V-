# Project
The goal of the project would be to provide additional resources to the main cs course
The website will provide practice questions that will complement what was learned for the week
Features:
- AI can help debug, provide hints and explain things
- A learn page which provides more detailed information about the week's topic
- The answer page provides a visualization of the problem for more comprehension
- In the terminal the ai can read the output and provide better error guides

if time allows for it we could add these features:
- Video tutorial and answer guide along with the text one
- Complete CS1 weeks (probably wont complete them all)
- User made theming

# Stack
the libaries and components the app will use
## Frontend

- bun - runtime
### Color palette
- [rosepine](https://rosepinetheme.com/palette/) with #211f20 for the background

## Backend
- python
- prob flask or something?
- server github hosting?  

# Flowchart
The user will recieve a the "front end" once  
content is changed and updated from json recieved from the server  
too lazy to make a detailed flow chart so this is good enough for now
